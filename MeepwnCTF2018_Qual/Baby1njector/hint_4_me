In this challenge I want my injectcode when it was injected to remote process, it can call functions in windows dll like malloc,strlen,sprintf... 
The idea is create an injector which inject BSNL.dll to svchost.exe process. The injector will create a magic global offset table (was defined in file inject.h) of svchost.exe process, then injector will inject shellcodes can call functions in BSNL.dll like malloc,sprintf,strlen...

The challenge use rc4 and a simple agorithm to encode :)
